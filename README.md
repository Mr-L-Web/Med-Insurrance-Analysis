# Med-Insurrance-Analysis
Portfolio project as part of the 'Data and Programming Foundations for AI' course from Codecademy. The goal of this project was to import medical data from a CSV and create functions to analyise data of my choosing. These include average cost of people who smoke and the number of people from each region.

No identifiable information is contained in the CSV.
